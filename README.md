## Overview
In this projext I use basic machine learning methods to examine a pricing dataset in this project The notebook, `Pricingdataset.ipynb`, helps to learn about the data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature analysis, and basic predictive modeling. The aim is to learn about what determines pricing and use the first stages of machine learning.
This work is part of the Practical Lab component for the Foundations of Machine Learning course.

## Repository Structure


## Project Objectives

- Look at and study a dataset with organized pricing details
- Be sure to finish all the necessary tasks before you create your model.
- Check out the data by doing an “exploratory data analysis.”
- Visualize feature distributions and relationships
- Figure out correlations between variables
- Using the simple machine learning models (e.g., linear regression)
- Testing the model’s success with the suitable form of measurement 

## Tools and Technologies

This project utilizes the following tools and Python libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash

pip install notebook
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
jupyter notebook Pricingdataset.ipynb

```

 ## Converted the notebook to HTML using:
```bash

 python -m jupyter nbconvert --to html Pricingdataset.ipynb

 ```
